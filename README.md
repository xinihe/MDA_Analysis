### CorEx Topic Modeling for Chinese MDA Analysis

[corex.ipynb](./code/corex.ipynb) implements CorEx (Correlation Explanation) topic modeling to analyze Chinese Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA) documents. The code processes Chinese text from MDA reports, identifies key topics, and extracts meaningful themes that appear across multiple documents. However, this word-level approach has inherent limitations: **it may not capture the full semantic meaning of sentences and phrases**, could miss important contextual relationships between words, and might not fully understand the nuanced meaning of financial and business concepts. For more accurate and meaningful analysis, we recommend using **semantic-level approaches** such as **Sentence Transformers** for semantic embedding, BERT-based models for **contextual understanding**, and **semantic similarity analysis** for theme identification. These semantic approaches can better capture the true meaning of MDA, contextual relationships between concepts, nuanced business discussions, and complex financial relationships.

### Sentence Transformers Topic Modelling for MDA

[sentence_transformers.ipynb](./code/sentence_transformers.ipynb) implements semantic analysis of Chinese Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA) documents using Sentence Transformers. The code processes Chinese text from MDA reports, converts sentences into semantic vectors, and enables various text analysis tasks such as similarity comparison, clustering, and semantic search.
